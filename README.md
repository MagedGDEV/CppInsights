# Arrays & Vectors

***Arrays*** are a collection of variables of the **same type** placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by using an index to a **unique identifier**.

Arrays have several characteristics:

- Size of the array is fixed
- Variables are of same type
- Stored in contiguous memory locations
- Each element can be accessed by using an index (position)
- Position of first element is **`0`** not **`1`**

To declare an array, we use the following syntax:

```cpp
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
```

For example:

```cpp
int numbers[5]; // array of 5 integers
double values[10]; // array of 10 doubles
```
