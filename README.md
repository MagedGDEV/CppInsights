# Functions

C++ functions allows us to modularize our program code, It allows us to break code into logical self-contained units. These units can be resused multiple times in the program.

Functions uses the ***Boss-Worker*** analogy, where the boss is the main program and the workers are the functions. The main program calls the functions to perform a specific task.

When you are calling functions in C++, you need to understand the following:

- What it does
- What it needs
- What it returns
- What errors it might produce
- Any constraints on its use

You won't need to know how the functions works internally to use it in your program, unless you are the one who wrote the function. C++ provides us with a lot of libraries that are filled up with loads of functions that you can use in your program.

> [!TIP]
> Don't reinvent the wheel, if there is a function that does what you want, use it.
