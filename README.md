# Introduction

Computer does exactly what you tell it to do. It doesn't know how to do anything on its own, when you write a program, you are giving the computer a series of commands that it will execute in order to perform some task.

Progams are written in multiple programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, etc. Each programming language has its own syntax and rules that must be followed to write a valid program in that language, we will be using C++ for this repository.

The programming language we write our is called high-level language which is understandable by humans. But computers doesn't know how to execute tasks from high-level lanaguage, So we need to convert our high-level language to low-level language which is in form of 0's and 1's, This process is done by a program called **compiler**, and each programming language has its own compiler.

Programs are made up of one or more files, the code in each file is linked together to form a single executable program, this process is done by a program called **linker**.
